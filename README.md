# SizeUnlocker
Since WEBFISHING v1.09, your size is very limited. This mod removes that limit, allowing you to be as big as you want. This is more meant to be used as a dependency: *you still need another mod to actually increase your size.*

<sub>A [WEBFISHING](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/) mod using [GDWeave](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave/), made in `C#`.</sub>

## Installation
> **NOTE:** GDWeave is required to use the mod, which can be found [here](https://github.com/NotNite/GDWeave/) if you do not have it yet.

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Nowaha/SizeUnlocker/releases/latest/download/SizeUnlocker.zip) and extract it inside of your `GDWeave/mods` folder, so that it exists as its own folder in there alongside your other mods.

You should end up with this structure:
```
GDWeave/
  mods/
    SizeUnlocker/
      manifest.json
      SizeUnlocker.dll
```
